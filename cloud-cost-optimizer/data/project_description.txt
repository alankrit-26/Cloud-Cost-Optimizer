 Hi, I want to build a market analysis tool for e-commerce. The tool should track
the highest-selling products each month. For the front end, I am using React, for the backend
Node.js, and MongoDB for storing the data. I’ll use Nginx as a proxy server and AWS for hosting.
My monthly budget is 3000.
